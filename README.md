# Georgia Registrar Scraper
 A small selenium script to scrape county registrar contact details in Georgia

The Georgia Secretary of State's [website](https://elections.sos.ga.gov/Elections/countyregistrars.do) has a list of contact details for county registrar's offices in the state, but it is not convenient to access this data. The county must be selected and then a button pressed to access the details for that county.

This script automates those actions and copies the contact details into a text file for convenience.
